# Tasks and Goals
Goal: Climactic final showdowns.

How can I make HP, Attack, and Defense equally-ish in viability.
Goal: Shared world creation. Create an interesting army/nation with reasonable creative freedom and meaningful gameplay changes.
Goal: Simple grand strategy/4X fun.
## Rules and Strategy

Better establish why it's better to be captured than killed

Figured out how to make placing a lot of tiles less of a drag?
- Engineering solution (complicated and expensive)

## Nation creation

### To experiment with the freedom of creativity, see how you would go about trying to create each of these

- Monster Hunters (Witchers or like the game)
- Inquisition
- Orc Horde
- Sauruman's commanded hordes
- Tomb Kings
- Cannonade empire
- Wood Elf Hippies
- Pokemon trainers
- Knights of the Round Table
- Hogwarts
- Mongols (fast attack)
- Dwarven fortresses

# Alt game modes

Captured command points

Flag mode/bomb mode (flag and bomb takes mod slot)

## Basic info:

### Composition of World:

18 by 18, 324 squares (eventual plan to switch to hex system). See

### Types of Resources:
- Bones: Used for dark magic
- Crystals: Used for most magic. Found in crystal caves
- Wood/nature: Used as either a building material or for the natural energy of the forest
- Food: Gathered from farmland. Used to support troops
- Metal: Gathered from iron mountains. Build armor and advanced tools

## Unit Attributes

### In MVP
- Mod card slots
- Speed
- Attack
- Defense
- Health
- Required resources
- Range (num of tiles between target and this unit)

### Maybe added later
- Command distance (how many ally occupied tiles between this and furthest reinforcing army)
- Micro front, flank and rear defense

## Micro Game (Not in MVP)

Squad level tactical game.

## Practicality
- Micro conflict has to be less than an hour
- Autoresolve is quick but satisfying
- Reason to fight major battles in micro
- What's turn structure when micro game going on?
- Easy to stow away between sessions
- Create asynchronous online version
- How to make the world creation fast as possible/convenient

## Low priority
- Fun Tactility

# Random Ideas
- Heroes can retreat or stay and chance permadeath
- Dice controlled/zombie/horde faction (always autoresolves)
- How do you throw some more collaborative world building in there? History? Features?
- For world gen to matter and not be a chore, terrain must matter
