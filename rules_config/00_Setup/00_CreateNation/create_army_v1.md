Depending on your tile choices you will have 1, 2 or 3 kinds of units organized into tiers. Follow the below instructions for each tier you have in your army.
1. Name your unit.
1. Answer the questions defining your unit. These change how you interact with the unit as well as how many Attribute Points (AP) you have to spend on the unit.
    - Do you lose if this unit is killed? If all of them are killed. Is your nation made of the thralls of a single powerful magician (Tier 1) and will collapse if they are slain? Do a council of witches (Tier 2) support the whole kingdom propping up a puppet king (Tier 1), meaning that the kingdom is lost if the council is all killed but will be fine if the king dies? Is your nation defined by its citizen army, and will be lost if all of your lowest soldiers are killed (Tier 3s)
    <!-- TODO rebalance the auto lose points, support int in rules config -->
    - Is this unit unique? Meaning you can only ever have 1 on the board.
    - How many do you start with?
    - How can you get more? You can select any number of these, however, adding more means that you will lose more AP.
    <!-- TODO define all terms on the sheet -->
1. Add the starting AP for the tier to the change from your unit decisions. Assign these points to your unit's 6 stats. All of these stats have a maximum of 6.
<!-- XXX Alternate method of ascribing AP cost (quadratic, fibbonacci etc) -->
  - **Max Health**: What it sounds like. The amount of damage your unit can take before it dies and is removed from the board.
  - **Defense**: Determines how hard it is to damage your units and how much damage you give when you counter-attack.
  - **Attack**: How much damage you are likely to dish out when attacking.
  - **Speed**: How far you can move in a turn and how hard it is for you to take damage in a counterattack.
  - **Range**: How many tiles can be between you and your target to attack or counterattack.
  - **Mod Slots**: How many mod cards you can apply to this tier of units
  <!-- TODO double cost for mod slots and range? -->
