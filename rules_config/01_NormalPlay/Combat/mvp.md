####  Combat

1. Attacker declares attack, target and which attacking units are reinforcing.
  * Units may reinforce on an attack if they:
    - Have not attacked or reinforced an attack this turn
    - Are adjacent to the primary attacking or defending unit AND/OR if they are within their Range attribute of the attacking or defending army
2. Defender declares reinforcements with same rules as attackers.
  * Units may reinforce on defense if they:
    - Have not defended or reinforced a defense this turn
    - Are adjacent to the primary attacking or defending unit AND/OR if they are within their Range attribute of the attacking or defending army
1. Attacker rolls 1 attack die per attack point on the attacking army and all reinforcing attackers.
1. Defending side receives 1 point of damage per attack die which rolls above or equal to the highest defense points among defender and defending reinforcements.
	- If the defender or defending reinforcements are in their own home capital, they may add 2 to that number up to a max of 6.
	- Damage must first go to the primary defender and then may be distributed as the defending player wishes among defending reinforcements.
	- No defending unit may receive more damage than its current health. Any defender with their health brought to 0 is considered dead and is removed from the board.
1. If the primary defender is reduced to 1/2 health or below, the primary defender moves off of the tile they were defending in the direction of the attacker's movement.
	- If there is an army on the defender's side in the way, they can be "bumped" in the same direction.
	- If there is an enemy army in the way, the primary defender is dead and removed from the game.
1. If the primary defender survives and the primary attacker is within range, the defender may choose to counterattack:
  - The defender rolls 1 die per the highest defense points among the primary defender and defending reinforcements. If the defender or defending reinforcements are in their own home capital, they may add 2 to that number up to a max of 6.
1. Attacker receives 1 point of damage for every defense die rolled above the attacking army's speed points.

1. The attacker may move onto the defenders tile if the defender is pushed off or dies.
