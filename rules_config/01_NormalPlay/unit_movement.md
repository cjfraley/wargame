1. Resolve start of turn tile effects:
  - Center Spire:
    Take 1 damage
    <!-- also considering `d6-3` -->
  - Medic:
    Gain 1 health (up to the max health)
1. A unit may skip its movement and attack to take 1 of the following actions on their current location:
  - Place a gatherer on a gold mine
  - Pick up a mod card from an unpillaged ruin
  - Buy a mod card from a merchant
  - Refill the merchant
  - Take over an existing gold mine
  - Take 2 gold from an occupied capital's player
  - Take 1 mod card from an occupied capital's extra cards
	- Heal completely on capital
	- Heal completely heal 1/2 your max health on medic space up to full health
1. Mod card handling:
  - Newly acquired mod cards can be placed onto your hero, your regular unit or your extra cards slot.
  - You may skip moving any units to rearrange cards between your hero, regular soldiers and extra cards.
<!-- Should this have a resource cost instead? -->
3. Move units and/or declare attacks. Players can move their units to one adjacent tile per speed point. This does not include diagonals (that's 1 vertical and 1 horizontal movement). Moving onto a mountain costs 2 speed points, moving onto an ocean costs 3. This does mean that you will need a mod card on a unit for it to be able to cross the ocean into other player's territory.
  - The player moving units can potentially start [combat](####Combat).
		- A unit may attack either by moving into the same square as an enemy unit or by moving within their range of an enemy unit and declaring an attack on that unit.
			- A unit must be able to move onto the square they are attacking
		- A unit cannot move after attacking even if they have extra movement points left.
		- A unit cannot attack while passing through a friendly unit.
<!-- 4. Capital may attack by itself if unoccupied. -->
<!-- 5. Units on friendly capital may regain 1 hp up to their max. -->
<!-- XXX Does this create a dominant strategy of stacking the high defense units behind attacking units? -->
