### 3. How it ends

There are 3 ways to win:

#### Conquest Victory
Be the only surviving nation. Nations are eliminated when their capital is occupied and they have no remaining units.
#### Economic Victory
Start your turn with 20 or more gold.
#### Spire Victory
Occupy the center spire for 3 continuous turns. Counts as a turn only if you start and end your turn on the spire. These can be different units but must continuously be held by the same nation.
  - A unit could move off and a second could move on in the same turn and remain continuous.
  - If a unit is knocked off the center spire on an opponents turn and then regains the center spire on their next turn, it is no longer considered continuous.
  - If a unit is killed by the spire itself, and another moves on to the center spire in the same turn, it is considered continuous.
