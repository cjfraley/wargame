# Instructions

## Macro Game

### 1. Set Up

Goal: Shared world creation. Create an interesting army/nation with reasonable creative freedom and meaningful gameplay changes.

#### 0. Create custom cards

#### 1. Create bare bones of nation

- Determine card points
  - 3 types of units. Start with these archetypes?
    - Tank
    - DPS
    - Special
    - And a single hero
- Shuffle unit mod cards
- Get starter cards
- Design units using starter cards
- Determine civ density. Let's say 3 settlements, 2 cities to start, 1 Capital


#### 2. Create world

1. Place Capitals equidistant around board. Go around in a circle laying available tiles until board is full.

2. Go around circle placing settlements and cities in your sector of the board. Determine source of each unit type

2. Place cards under location tiles where called for.

#### 3. Flesh out nation and world details

- Determine what resources you use for what

### 2. Normal Play

Goal: Simple grand strategy/4X fun.

#### On your turn

1. Resource gathering <!-- I'd like to have players need to wait a turn to get resource but without trying to -->

3. Move units to a max distance of their speed. Mountains cost 2 moves to move across. Water costs 3.
  1. If necessary resolve conflict
  1. If possible/desired, draw cards from owned tiles.
  2. Place resource gathering tokens in captured territories (but not resources)
  <!-- TODO determine limit on resource gatherers -->

2. Build units
- Choose a surviving city or settlement
- Choose a unit with that

3. Pick where to spend resources and place required resources on it?

4. Remove a tile from the game board.  
    If you can, you must remove a tile on the edge following the below rules. If none of these are available, follow the same rules for internal tiles
    1. Unoccupied by any resource gatherers, any settlements and by any armies
    1. Unoccupied by any gatherers
    1. Unoccupied by any armies
    1. Occupied by an enemy gatherer but not an enemy army
    1. Occupied by an enemy army but not an enemy gatherer
    1. Occupied by both an enemy army and an enemy gatherer

####  Combat

- Unless otherwise specified, only the primary attacking and defending army's special abilities are triggered
- If attacking a city. Defender adds cities defense points to defending army
- Cities can start a fight from 2 tiles away. Defending army can't cause any damage unless it has the range attribute and are within range

1. Attacker roll 1 die per attack point on attacking army and any allied army adjacent to target army. 6s explode <!-- Do I want to instead make exploding 6s a card -->
2. Defender roll 1 die per defense point on defending army and any allied army adjacent to target army. 6s explode
3. Loser takes damage of difference
  - Reinforcing armies take remainder of damage after primary army is killed unless it's a ranged reinforcement
4. Loser moves 1 space off the field of battle in the direction of movement of the attacker or its reverse


### 3. How it ends

Goal: Climactic final showdowns.

The game ends when only one nation survives.
