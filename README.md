# The Tower of Spugah

# ToDo List
- Organize notes from initial test game
- ~Create inventory of cards~
- ~Create stuff for mvp game~
- MVP webapp
- Dynamic instructions built from options
- Reduce amount of water in tiles
- Either move past rectangular tile version or make the first turn gold mine impossible
- Add more speed up/water crossing cards
- Split speed and water crossing cards (maybe even convert most to speed down cards)
- Clarify on cards, when unit created, where does it go?
- Edit rules for consistency
  - Actions
  - Occupied gold gathering
- On physical prototype, add easy way to track center spire occupation. When using dice as soldiers, it made sense to build a dice tower
- Rectangular prototype: Add bridge to quadrant tile
- Illustrate directions (especially bonking)
- Add some more attack based cards

<!-- ## Physical prototypes
- Cardboard tiles and tray
- Shop and ruin sheets
- Farm tiles -->

# Goals/Ideas

## Core Hooks
- Card/Roguelite like unit creation
- Allow shared world creation
- RPG esque feeling of ownership/attachment over nation
- Interesting custom unit creation with weird synergies
- Macro and micro game feeding well into one another
