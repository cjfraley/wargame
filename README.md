    + For wold gen to matter and not be a chore, terrain must matter
- Interesting custom unit creation with weird synergies
- Macro and micro game feeding well into one another

## Practicality
- Micro conflict has to be less than an hour
- Autoresolve is quick but satisfying
- Reason to fight major battles in micro
- What's turn structure when micro game going on?
- Easy to stow away between sessions
- Create asynchronous online version
- How to make the world creation fast as possible/convenient

## Low priority
- Fun Tactility

# Random Ideas
- Heroes can retreat or stay and chance permadeath
- Dice controlled/zombie/horde faction (always autoresolves)
- How do you throw some more collaborative world building in there? History? Features?
