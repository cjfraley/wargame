# Instructions

## Macro Game

### 1. Set Up

#### 0. Create custom cards

If you want to add your own cards, write them out. If the players unanimously agree it can be part of the game, shuffle it into the mod card deck.

#### 1. Create nation

1. Determine what resources you use for creating your units: Draw 6 resource pips. Distribute as you wish on your 3 unit cost slots.
2. Draw 2 mod cards and place them on your army sheet.

<!-- - Determine card points
  - 3 types of units. Start with these archetypes?
    - Tank
    - DPS
    - Special
    - And a single hero
- Shuffle unit mod cards
- Get starter cards
- Design units using starter cards
- Determine civ density. Let's say 3 settlements, 2 cities to start, 1 Capital
- Determine what resources you use for what -->

#### 2. Create world

<!-- 1. Place Capitals equidistant around board. Go around in a circle laying available tiles until board is full. -->
1. Go in a circle placing tiles (including cities and settlements) until board is full.
1. Place mod cards face down on treasure hunting sheet.

### 2. Normal Play


#### On your turn

1. Resource gathering <!-- I'd like to have players need to wait a turn to get resource but without trying to -->

2. Resolve tile effects like the center spire giving an automatic 1 point of damage (also considering `d6-3`)

3. Move units to a max distance of their speed. Mountains cost 2 moves to move across. Water costs 3.
  1. If necessary resolve conflict
  1. If possible/desired, draw cards from owned tiles.
  2. Place resource gathering tokens in captured territories (but not resources)
  <!-- TODO determine limit on resource gatherers -->

2. Build units
- Choose a surviving capital, city or settlement
  * Settlements can build a level 1 army
  * Cities can build a level 2 army or 2 level 1s
  * Capitals can build a level 3 army or a level 2 and level 1 or 3 x level 1 armies
- Choose a unit to create with that settlement
- Return required resources to the bank

1. If you capture a resource source in your movement phase,

3. Pick where to spend resources and place required resources on it?

4. Remove a tile from the game board.  
    If you can, you must remove a tile on the edge following the below rules. If none of these are available, follow the same rules for internal tiles
    1. Unoccupied by any resource gatherers, any settlements and by any armies
    1. Unoccupied by any gatherers
    1. Unoccupied by any armies
    1. Occupied by an enemy gatherer but not an enemy army
    1. Occupied by an enemy army but not an enemy gatherer
    1. Occupied by both an enemy army and an enemy gatherer

####  Combat

- Unless otherwise specified, only the primary attacking and defending army's special abilities are triggered
- If attacking a city. Defender adds cities defense points to defending army
- Cities can start a fight from 2 tiles away. Defending army can't cause any damage unless it has the range attribute and are within range

1. Attacker roll 1 die per attack point on attacking army and any allied army adjacent to target army. <!-- Do I want to instead make exploding 6s a card -->
1. Defender receives 1 point of damage per die rolled over the main defender's defense points or the highest defense points of a reinforcing defending army.
1. If the defender survives, defender rolls 1 die per defense point of the main defender's defense points or the highest defense points of a reinforcing defending army.
1. Attacker receives 1 point of damage for every die rolled above the attacking army's speed points.
<!-- Alternative dice 2. Defender roll 1 die per defense point on defending army and any allied army adjacent to target army. -->
<!-- 3. Loser takes damage of difference
  - Reinforcing armies take remainder of damage after primary army is killed unless it's a ranged reinforcement -->
1. If the defender is reduced to 1/2 health, the defender moves off of the tile they were defending in the direction of the attacker's movement.
1. The attacker may move onto the defenders tile if the defender is pushed off or dies
<!-- 4. Loser moves 1 space off the field of battle in the direction of movement of the attacker or its reverse -->
