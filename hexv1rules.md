###### Your story

Fill in your nations name and the adjective used to describe those who come from your nation and your lands


Optionally sketch your nations flag or emblem


Write a one sentence explanation on why your nation should be the one to survive.


###### Tile Choices

You have 15 choices to make describing your nation in both makeup and geography represented by the two sides of your 15 tiles. Some tiles will simply be a choice of which type of terrain you'd like to include on your nation. Others will have consequences for your army. Each binary choice corresponds to a side of the tile to have face up.


Place these tiles with the correct face up on your continent tray.

Depending on your tile choices you will have 1, 2 or 3 kinds of units organized into tiers. Follow the below instructions for each tier you have in your army.
1. Name your unit.
1. Answer the questions defining your unit. These change how you interact with the unit as well as how many Attribute Points (AP) you have to spend on the unit.
    - Do you lose if this unit is killed? If all of them are killed. Is your nation made of the thralls of a single powerful magician (Tier 1) and will collapse if they are slain? Do a council of witches (Tier 2) support the whole kingdom propping up a puppet king (Tier 1), meaning that the kingdom is lost if the council is all killed but will be fine if the king dies? Is your nation defined by its citizen army, and will be lost if all of your lowest soldiers are killed (Tier 3s)
    <!-- TODO rebalance the auto lose points, support int in rules config -->
    - Is this unit unique? Meaning you can only ever have 1 on the board.
    - How many do you start with?
    - How can you get more? You can select any number of these, however, adding more means that you will lose more AP.
    <!-- TODO define all terms on the sheet -->
1. Add the starting AP for the tier to the change from your unit decisions. Assign these points to your unit's 6 stats. All of these stats have a maximum of 6.
<!-- XXX Alternate method of ascribing AP cost (quadratic, fibbonacci etc) -->
  - **Max Health**: What it sounds like. The amount of damage your unit can take before it dies and is removed from the board.
  - **Defense**: Determines how hard it is to damage your units and how much damage you give when you counter-attack.
  - **Attack**: How much damage you are likely to dish out when attacking.
  - **Speed**: How far you can move in a turn and how hard it is for you to take damage in a counterattack.
  - **Range**: How many tiles can be between you and your target to attack or counterattack.
  - **Mod Slots**: How many mod cards you can apply to this tier of units
  <!-- TODO double cost for mod slots and range? -->





### 2. Create World
1. Go clockwise around the players each one placing their continent tray on the table around the center spire.

2. Go around in the reverse order (starting with last player to place their tile). Each player may choose to rotate their tray.

### 3. Initial Unit Placement
1. Place (one of) your highest tier starting units on your capital.
2. Place your other starting units adjacent to the capital.
### 4. Other Setup
1. Fill the shop sheet with cards face up. Roll a die per card to determine their prices.
1. Fill ruins sheet with face down cards. There should be 2 cards for each ruin.

## Normal Play

#### On your turn

As a general guideline, your turn has 3 steps:
- Recruit units
- Gather gold
- Take Action or Move and Attack

Sometimes referred to as SpGA (pronounced Spugah) for Spawn, Gold, Action.


#### 1. Recruit units
You may build units on your capital if your capital is unoccupied (including by friendly forces).
1. Pay to the bank the number of mod cards on the unit +1 gold.
1. Place your new unit on your capital. It may start moving this turn but no additional units can be built that turn (if not allowed by a mod card).



#### 2. Gather gold
1. Take 1 gold from the bank for each, placed gatherer if unoccupied (including by friendly units)
1. Take 1 gold from the bank if your capital is unoccupied (including by friendly units and newly created units)
<!-- TODO determine limit on resource gatherers -->




#### 3. Troop Movement
1. Resolve start of turn tile effects:
  - Center Spire:
    Take 1 damage
    <!-- also considering `d6-3` -->
  - Medic:
    Gain 1 health (up to the max health)
1. A unit may skip its movement and attack to take 1 of the following actions on their current location:
  - Place a gatherer on a gold mine
  - Pick up a mod card from an unpillaged ruin
  - Buy a mod card from a merchant
  - Refill the merchant
  - Take over an existing gold mine
  - Take 2 gold from an occupied capital's player
  - Take 1 mod card from an occupied capital's extra cards
	- Heal completely on capital
	- Heal completely heal 1/2 your max health on medic space up to full health
1. Mod card handling:
  - Newly acquired mod cards can be placed onto your hero, your regular unit or your extra cards slot.
  - You may skip moving any units to rearrange cards between your hero, regular soldiers and extra cards.
<!-- Should this have a resource cost instead? -->
3. Move units and/or declare attacks. Players can move their units to one adjacent tile per speed point. This does not include diagonals (that's 1 vertical and 1 horizontal movement). Moving onto a mountain costs 2 speed points, moving onto an ocean costs 3. This does mean that you will need a mod card on a unit for it to be able to cross the ocean into other player's territory.
  - The player moving units can potentially start [combat](####Combat).
		- A unit may attack either by moving into the same square as an enemy unit or by moving within their range of an enemy unit and declaring an attack on that unit.
			- A unit must be able to move onto the square they are attacking
		- A unit cannot move after attacking even if they have extra movement points left.
		- A unit cannot attack while passing through a friendly unit.
<!-- 4. Capital may attack by itself if unoccupied. -->
<!-- 5. Units on friendly capital may regain 1 hp up to their max. -->
<!-- XXX Does this create a dominant strategy of stacking the high defense units behind attacking units? -->



## How the game ends
### Economic Victory
If any player begins their turn with more than 30 resources, they win.
### Elimination Victory
You can eliminate other players by occupying their capital and defeating all of their units. 
### Spire Victory
Occupy the center spire for 3 continuous turns. Counts as a turn only if you start and end your turn on the spire. These can be different units but must continuously be held by the same nation.
  - A unit could move off and a second could move on in the same turn and remain continuous.
  - If a unit is knocked off the center spire on an opponents turn and then regains the center spire on their next turn, it is no longer considered continuous.
  - If a unit is killed by the spire itself, and another moves on to the center spire in the same turn, it is considered continuous.
